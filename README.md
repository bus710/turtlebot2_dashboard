# turtlebot2_dashboard

A GUI demo to drive Turtle Bot 2. 

The demo consists of Flutter GUI and Rust library. (Thanks to [Flutter-Rust-Bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge) to make this happen!) The Flutter desktop app shows the state of the robot and the Rust library translates the commands and data to connect the app and the robot.
